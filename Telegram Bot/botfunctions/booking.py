    Command handler for the '/book' command.
    Allows users to book an appointment.

    This code defines a command handler that allows users to book an appointment. 
    It first checks if the user is registered in the system. If not registered, it sends a message to prompt the user to start the profile creation process. 
    If the user is registered, it creates a local booking object and stores it in the bookings dictionary. 
    Next, the current date and time are fetched and displayed to the user. 
    Then, a list of dates for the next 14 days is generated. Each date is converted into a button label and an InlineKeyboardButton object is created for each date. 
    An InlineKeyboardMarkup is created with the list of buttons, and a message with the calendar keyboard for date selection is sent to the user. 
    The conversation state is set to Book.picked_date to track the progress of the conversation.

    Usage:

    User sends the /book command to initiate the booking process.
    The function checks if the user is registered in the system by querying the database.
    If the user is not registered, a message is sent to prompt the user to start the profile creation process.
    If the user is registered, a local booking object is created and stored in the bookings dictionary.
    The current date, current time, and dates for the next 14 days are fetched.
    The current date and time are displayed to the user.
    A list of button labels is created for each date.
    InlineKeyboardButton objects are created for each date using the button labels.
    An InlineKeyboardMarkup object is created with the list of buttons.
    A message with the calendar keyboard for date selection is sent to the user.
    The conversation state is set to Book.picked_date to track the progress of the conversation.

    Example:

    User: /book

    Bot: Sure, let's display available dates
    Current date is 2023-05-18
    Time is 15:30:00

    Bot: Select date
    [Inline keyboard with date options is displayed]
    In the example above, the user sends the /book command. The bot responds by displaying the current date and time. It then presents an inline keyboard with date options for the user

    Parameters:
    - message: The message object representing the user's message.
    - state: The FSMContext object for managing the conversation state.

async def bookStageViewSlots(call: types.CallbackQuery, state: FSMContext):
    """
    Callback query handler for viewing available time slots for booking.

    Usage:

    This callback query handler is triggered when the user selects a date from the calendar keyboard presented after the /book command. 
    It processes the selected date and checks if it is in the past. 

    If the selected date is in the past, a message is sent to the user informing them that booking in the past is not allowed and the conversation is finished. 
    If the selected date is valid, the handler retrieves the available time slots for the selected date from the database.
    If the selected date is different from the current date, the handler retrieves all time slots for that date and generates a message displaying the availability of each time slot. 
    The user can select a specific time slot for booking from the displayed options.

    If the selected date is the current date, the handler retrieves only the available time slots from the current time onwards. 
    If no available time slots are found, a message is sent to the user indicating that there are no more available time slots for the day. 
    Otherwise, the available time slots are displayed, and the user can select a specific time slot for booking.
    After displaying the available time slots, the conversation state is set to Book.picked_time to track the progress of the conversation.

    Example:

    User: [Selects a date from the calendar keyboard]

    Bot: [Displays the available time slots for the selected date]
        Slots at a glance
        09:00 ✅
        10:00 ❌
        11:00 ✅
        12:00 ✅
        [Inline keyboard with time options is displayed]
    In the example above, the user selects a date from the calendar keyboard. 
    The bot responds by displaying the available time slots for that date. 
    Each time slot is marked with either a ✅ (available) or ❌ (not available). 
    The user can then select a specific time slot from the displayed options.

    This callback query handler is triggered when the user selects a specific time slot for booking from the available options. 
    It checks if the user has selected the option to pick another date. 
    If so, it restarts the booking process by calling the bookCycle function. 
    Otherwise, it retrieves the selected time slot and performs the necessary database operations to book the slot for the user.
    If the user has not booked the maximum number of slots for themselves on that day, the selected time slot is updated in the database as booked, and a confirmation message is sent to the user. 
    If there are still available slots for booking on that day, the user is prompted with a yes/no question asking if they want to book additional slots. 
    The conversation state is set to Book.additional_time to track the progress of the conversation.

    If the user has already booked the maximum number of slots for themselves on that day, a message is sent to the user indicating that they have reached the maximum limit. 
    The conversation is then finished.

    Example:

    User: [Selects a time slot for booking]

    In the example above, the user selects a specific time slot for booking. 
    The bot confirms the booking and provides the date and time of the booked slot. 
    It then asks the user if they want to book additional slots for the same day. 
    The user can choose to either book more slots by selecting 'Yes' or finish the booking process by selecting 'No'.

    Message handler for the /checkactive command to retrieve and display the active gym slots booked by the user.

    Parameters:
    - message: The Message object representing the incoming message.

    Usage:

    User sends the /checkactive command to check their active gym slots.
    The function retrieves the current date and time.
    It queries the database to fetch the active slots booked by the user for the current date and time, as well as future dates.
    If no active slots are found, it sends a message response indicating that there are no active slots.
    If active slots are found, it constructs a response message listing the booked slots' date and time.
    The response message is sent back to the user.

    Example:

    User: /checkactive

    Bot: ⌛ Slots booked on

    2023-05-18 on 09:00 👌

    2023-05-19 on 10:30 👌
