Updated from 0.2.0 onwards, contact @frostbitepillars on Telegram

1) In-line keyboard is nice to see but it is not possible to differentiate previous in-line keyboards and current.
So even if time-slot is not offered, they can find a keyboard that offers it and exploit it.
    1.1) Fix this by adding final SQL checks.
    1.2) Validation check for both time and date, use regular expression module?
2) Possible major glitch, looks like I may have wrongly assumed that the classes are local to the instance of user running. It is not. Fixed in 0.2.3 by passing
in relevant info through functions instead.
