Updated from 0.2.0 onwards, contact @frostbitepillars on Telegram

1) Implement regular expression checks for date and time
2) Add in-case SQL check to validate (whether that timeslot actually has vacancy), whether date is >= curr.date
3) Add current date handling, I skipped that as I wanted to see if the general idea works, since it does(?) now need
to handle time checks for current date (added)
4) If possible to reduce commands for info changing and create a single response way using states?
